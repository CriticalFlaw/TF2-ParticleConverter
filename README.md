## TF2-Particle Converter

### Instructions
Place your image files in the `frames` folder, launch the tool and click **Convert**. The files must be PNG images, numbered in the order that you want them animated (*0.png, 1.png, 2.png* so on) or if you want a single image then name it *0.png*. If the `frames` folder is not the root application folder, either create it manually or restart the application.
